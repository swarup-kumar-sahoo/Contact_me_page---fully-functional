# Contact_me_page---fully-functional
A simple form validation website using web3forms.
It is very useful for beginers.
I have created a contact page using html and tailwind css.
When ever you will message on the contact form it will directly forward the message to my email.
You can also use this form by changing value in input section.
Instead of value you have to write public access key which you can easily find in WWW.web3forms.com .
